                <h2>Work History</h2>
                <p>My first job was collecting eggs, mucking stalls and hauling hay bales on our small farm.</p>
                <p>I worked as a dishwasher, house painter, research assistant, and then as a film projectionist and postal sorter through high school and college.</p>
                <p>After college, I supported my running dreams through work in postal delivery, as a phone technician, 
                    babysitter, massage therapist, data entry clerk, fitness instructor and many other side jobs.</p>
                <p>Five years as a semi-pro runner led me all over North America and Europe, ending in retirement in 2004.</p>
                <p>While working as a legal office assistant (a glorified gopher), I took a community college journalism class and fell in love with the family business: newspapers.</p>
                <p>After two years as an editor in California, we relocated back to Vermont to start a family and I joined the Rutland Herald in the spring of 2008 as 
                    special projects manager. I worked on paid online subscriptions, overhauling our marketing materials, and in various newsroom roles. 
                </p>
                <p>After my family sold the papers in 2016, in the middle of a financial crisis, I stayed on in a leadership role until leaving to pursue
                    coding and data science in early 2020.
